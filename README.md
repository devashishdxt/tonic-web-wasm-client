# tonic-web-wasm-client

Rust implementation of [`grpc-web`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md) protocol that allows
using [`tonic`](https://crates.io/crates/tonic) in browsers via webassembly.

## Usage

To use `tonic-web-wasm-client`, you need to add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tonic-web-wasm-client = "0.5"
```

### Example
To use `tonic` gRPC clients in browser, compile your code with tonic's `transport` feature disabled (this will disable
the default transport layer of tonic). Then initialize the query client as follows:

```rust
use tonic_web_wasm_client::Client;

let base_url = "http://localhost:9001"; // URL of the gRPC-web server
let query_client = QueryClient::new(Client::new(base_url)); // `QueryClient` is the client generated by tonic

let response = query_client.status().await; // Execute your queries the same way as you do with defaule transport layer
```

### Building

Since `tonic-web-wasm-client` is primarily intended for use in browsers, a crate that uses `tonic-web-wasm-client`
can only be built for `wasm32` target architectures:

```shell
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Other option is to create a `.cargo/config.toml` in your crate repository and add a build target there:

```toml
[build]
target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
```
